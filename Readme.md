# Falling Arrows (16-bit)

A [Super Silly Hackathon](https://supersillyhackathon.sg/) collaboration between myself and [Yeo Kheng Meng](https://github.com/yeokm1/) where we endeavoured to build a Windows 3.1 application in 2019. 

Base [Windows 16-bit project](https://github.com/TransmissionZero/Win16-Example-Application) by [TransmissionZero](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/) and modified by Kheng Meng to include helper functions. Kheng Meng had previously built a Slack Client on Windows 3.1 and wrote about it in a [HackerNews-topping blog post](http://yeokhengmeng.com/2019/12/building-a-new-win-3-1-app-in-2019-part-1-slack-client/).

My more useless recap of the SSH experience is [documented here](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/building-a-win31-app-in-2019/).
